# CCNA-Project-1


"I have created this project to test my foundational understanding about the basic blocks of networking"

The protocols and techniques that have been used for this project are as follows:
===================================================================================

1- Subneting

2- VLAN's, VLAN TRUNK , VTP, DTP, Inter-VLAN routing

3- STP and PVST+

4- Dynamic-Routing (OSPF)




Note: When opening this project in "Cisco packet tracer", if you find that the project is kind of messy due to the notes and the end nodes interfaces, switch interfaces and so on; you can hide those interfaces:
first, in the tool bar of the cisco packet; click on "Options" tab -> then "Prefferences" -> after that, un-check the "Always show port labels in logical workspace".
